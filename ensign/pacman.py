"""Cross-reference pacman's own file-integrity check against Ensign's
tracked hashes -- entirely local, nothing leaves the machine.

`pacman -Qkk` verifies every installed file against the checksums,
sizes, and permissions pacman recorded when the package was installed.
A mismatch means "this file differs from what the package manager
thinks it installed" -- which is either a legitimate local edit (a
config file you changed on purpose) or something worth a closer look.
Ensign can't tell those apart on its own; this just surfaces pacman's
findings and, where Ensign has also scanned the same file, shows what
Ensign's last look at it found.

# shapes are handled: "warning: pkg: /path (reason)" for genuine
# mismatches, and "backup file: pkg: /path (reason)" for pacman's own
# backup/config files -- the latter is expected to differ (that's what
# marking a file "backup" means: pacman won't complain about you
# editing it) and is reported separately, not alongside real anomalies.
# The bulk of `-Qkk` output is neither shape -- one "N total files, M
