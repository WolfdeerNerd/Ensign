"""Path patterns suggesting a secrets/credentials store.

Design: three confidence tiers, not one flat list.

  HIGH   -- exact, canonical, tool-defined names (directories, fixed
            filenames, distinctive extensions). These essentially never
            collide with unrelated content by accident.
  MEDIUM -- naming conventions/prefixes that need directory context to
            be trustworthy (e.g. Ethereum's UTC-- keystore prefix only
            means something inside a keystore/ folder; id_* only means
            something inside .ssh/).
  (anything else is NOT flagged -- bare English words like "wallet",
  "secrets", "keystore" are deliberately excluded; they were the
  source of most false positives under the old substring-matching
  approach and add negligible real coverage.)

Used two ways, at two different confidence thresholds:
  - reports.py (suggest_fixes): gates whether to print a ready-to-run
    setfacl command. A missed real secret here is the costly mistake
    (Ensign would suggest granting clamd group read access to actual
    credentials), so this call site checks at the WIDER threshold
    (HIGH or MEDIUM) -- when in doubt, don't suggest the command.
  - scanner.py (process_file): reclassifies a permission-denied result
    as CLASSIFIED (expected) instead of ERROR (chased). A false match
    here just hides a real permission problem behind "expected, not a
    bug," so this call site checks at the NARROWER threshold (HIGH
    only) -- when in doubt, leave it as a real error to look at.

Deliberately conservative either way: this is a deny-list, not a
guarantee. It will miss a secrets store whose name doesn't match
anything here (a custom password manager with an obscure directory
name, for instance). That's an accepted, known gap -- see:

docs/Classified_Paths_Research.md

for how each entry was sourced.
